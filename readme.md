# Elastic Path Maze Path Finder

I saw this "developer challenge" when I was looking at jobs in the Portland area. Some Elastic 
Path jobs came up in Vancouver (unfortunately, the job site I was on couldn't differentiate 
between Vancouver, WA (US) and Vancouver, BC (CA)); and they mentioned solving this challenge as 
a test. It fit with some libraries I wanted to learn more about anyway:
 
 * Retrofit
 * Gson
 
## Code Structure

So I thought I would tackle the challenge. I'm not completely happy with the structure of my 
solution, but since it's just for learning about interacting with Retrofit from Kotlin, I'm not 
that worried about it. 

I realize that the entire thing could have been solved in a single class; I wanted to 
experiment with how to structure the interactions as I would use them in a larger application, 
since that's how I'll use Retrofit in the "real world".
